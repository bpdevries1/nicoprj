Intro
=====
* Periodically move library functions from the projects where they are first used to this general place.
* This is almost by definition a post-hoc activity, as we don't know beforehand if a function will become a lib function.

find ~/nicoprj -name "*.tcl" -mtime -365

# lib in filename
find ~/nicoprj -name "*lib*.tcl" -mtime -365
find ~/perftoolset -name "*lib*.tcl" -mtime -365

# could also compare time with time of TODO and/or HISTORY file here.

# lib in contents
find ~/nicoprj -path '*/lib' -prune -o -name "*.tcl" -mtime -365 -exec ~/aaa/greplib.sh {} \;
find ~/perftoolset -name "*.tcl" -mtime -365 -exec ~/aaa/greplib.sh {} \;

Concrete todo
=============
* Checked files on 26-12-2011 and handled everything, so next time check from this date.
